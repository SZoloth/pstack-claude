# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `sonnet`. Resolve it per **Parsing a role value** in `poteto-mode/references/claude-code-runtime.md`. Valid values, and how to spawn a `codex` value, are under **Model values** in `poteto-mode/references/claude-code-runtime.md`. If a value is invalid, use the default and say so. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message with `subagent_type: general-purpose`, `isolation: "worktree"`, `run_in_background: true`, and the step 3 model, resolved per **Parsing a role value**. Drop `isolation` for a read-only worker that writes nothing. Use `isolation: "remote"` only when the session offers it and the worker needs nothing on this machine. Run at most about 6 workers at once on one machine and queue the rest.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, its brief's first step is `git fetch origin <branch> && git switch -C <worker-branch> origin/<branch>` in its worktree.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
